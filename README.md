# Palmoral group Case study

Having gained an understanding of Palmoral group alogside the issues the company is currently facing which is related to gender equality, Salary gaps and Compliance with regulation. These issues will be picked with detalied nalysis based on data in the datasheet from employee data.

## Compliance with Regulation.

Following a recent regulation which requires manufacturing companies to pay a minimum of $90,000 to employees, this poses a great challenge for Palmoral group as the salary range is between 28,160 and 127,097. Further check shows that about 605 employeees earn less than 90,000 and those earning above 90,000 are 323 employees which is about 47% of the total employee.

### Alternatives availaable for Compliance with the new Regulation
1. Eearly retirement / Reduction of Directors and Senior Management: It is virtually certain that payment interms of Salary, bonuses, allowance and other perks for Directors and Senior management staff will take an integral part of salary as we can see that over 47% of staff earn above $90,000 and out of this proprtion, its not out of place to say that 30% out of 47% fall into category of senior management and director. Once Palmoral group can explore this, there will be savings to cater fot this new requlation.
2. Downsize based on Appraisal/ Ratings: A spool of the employee record shows some underperforming staff rated as "poor and very poor" earning $90,000 and above whereas some staff that fall in rating of "good and very good" earn way less than 90,000. I will present this figure andjustification to the CHRO(Mr Shofoluwe) to take a decision on downsizing.
3. Reveiw Payroll Schedule: There is a possibility that an exited staff is being paid afetr he has left Palmoral group. Since the staff strength is quite robust, a review should be done to identify ghost workers and update the record. This wil help us to ascertain that payment is being done to the right personnel.
4. Establish branch in another country that has liberal regulation on Pay: Another option to explore is the estblishment of a branch of Palmoral in another country that does not have strict regulation on Payment of Salary to staff. They can take advantage of this liberal policy.

## Gender Equality
After assignment of gender to staff that did not provide their gender, Palmoral group has about 484 male employees and 462 female employees with a difference of 22 which is fair as it has more men in the workforce than women. This would have raised more question if the margin was high and will attract attention of some stakeholders.
However, we need to distill down to regions as its but further check shows this has been evenly spread among the three regions. Since the issue of gender inequality poses a challenge to the company, this can be balanced from the proposition earlier advised regards compliance with new regulation.
Also, we can have the same number of gender holding significant posotions, possibly this is not what we have in Palmoral.
Since gender equality has been a campaign among women in our generation, It will be fair to have women in equal number with men in some departments like engineering.

## Salary gap

The Salary gap at Palmoral is quite large showing a range from 28,160 to 127,097.
A female legal personnel earning about 28,000 and another female support personnel earning over 107,000. Even in human resouce department, female staff whose rating is goos earns 36,460 while a male staff with same good rating earns 103,490. This could be as a result of different grade level, another factor to be considered is mode of employement either fulltime of contract.
